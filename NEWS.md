# matsindf 0.4.4 (2023-08-18) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8264195.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8264195)

* Fixed a bug in `matsindf_apply()` where a 
  a data frame column with some named elements
  and some unnamed elements led to the unnamed elements
  yielding `0` or `NULL` results after `FUN` was applied.
  The fix was to `unname()` everything before calling
  `purrr::transpose()`.

# matsindf 0.4.2 (2023-05-04) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7896799.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7896799)

* Move to latest version of GitHub test coverage workflow.
* This version not released to CRAN.
* No new tests.
    * Still at 374 tests, all passing.

# matsindf 0.4.1 (2023-04-26) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7868736.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7868736)

* The mapping of length-`1` strings in the `...` argument of 
  `matsindf_apply()` now extends to default arguments of `FUN`.
* The rewrite of `matsindf_apply()` enables better error and warning messages in many places.
* Rewrote all of `matsindf_apply()`.
  It was a complete mess!
  Hopefully, it is now easier to debug and maintain.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now correctly returns a list when lists are provided in the `...` argument.
      Previously, it incorrectly returned a data frame.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now correctly disallows any unused arguments supplied in its `...` argument.
      Previously, some unused argument situations were not flagged as errors,
      despite documentation saying they would be.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now gives warning messages when an argument to `FUN` cannot be found
      in any of `...`, `.dat`, or defaults to `FUN`. 
      This condition may be OK, and the caller can suppress the warning by passing
      `.warn_missing_FUN_args = FALSE` to `matsindf_apply()`.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now gives more descriptive error messages.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now allows more options for incoming data.
    * `matsindf_apply()` now tries really hard to deal with empty inputs, 
      falling back to returning the original input 
      unmodified (except possibly wrapped in a `list()`) when 
      the input has zero rows (in the case of a data frame)
      or zero length (in the case of lists).
* Many new tests to verify that the package works after rewriting `matsindf_apply()`.
    - Now at 374 tests, all passing.
    - Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.4.0 (2023-03-07) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7713764.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7713764)

* All functions now work with both `matrix` and `Matrix` objects,
  thereby enabling use of sparse matrices.
  Use `matsbyname::Matrix()` to create sparse matrices
  as appropriate.
* `mat_to_rowcolval()` now accepts `Matrix` objects
  in the `.matrix` argument.
* `rowcolval_to_mat()` gains a `matrix.class` argument
  that specifies whether a `matrix` or a `Matrix` 
  should be created.
* Many new tests to verify that the package works with `Matrix` objects.
    - Now at 323 tests, all passing.
    - Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.12 (2023-01-24) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7567047.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7567047)

* Fixed a differential error message challenge for tests.
* Move tests associated with `verify_cols_missing()`
  from the `Recca` package to `matsindf`.
  Those tests didn't belong in `Recca`.
* Updated to the latest version of the github actions
  continuous integration workflow.
* Better docs for `expand_to_tidy()`.
* New function `matrix_cols()` tells which columns contain matrices, 
  either in the `any()` sense or in the `all()` sense.
* Improved `matsindf_apply()` primer vignette
  discusses how to handle heterogeneous arguments
  types to `FUN`.
* New tests to verify `matsindf_apply()` when using string arguments to `FUN`.
    * Now at 209 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.11 (2022-05-18) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6564300.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6564300)

* Fixed a very subtle bug in `matsindf_apply()` where the list returned from `Map()`
  had names on each individual item.
  The names on individual items caused problems  
  only when later calling a binary (or n-ary) `matsbyname` function 
  with both a named and an unnamed list, because 
  those functions expect the same name structure.
  The solution was to remove the names from each individual item
  after calling `Map()` and
  before calling `purrr::transpose()`.
* No new tests.
    * Still at 195 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.10 (2021-12-17) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5789218.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5789218)

* New vignette from Alexander Davis shows how to use `matsindf` 
  for principal components analysis (PCA).
* Move to `testthat` v3.
* Adapt to refactoring `RCLabels` package out of `matsbyname`.
* `rowtypes` and `coltypes` arguments now have special defaults
  to enable calling `collapse_to_matrices()` without specifying those arguments.
* Added more tests for `collapse_to_matrices()` to check
  whether `NULL` values for `rowtype` and `coltype` arguments
  are handled correctly.
* New tests for new features.
    * Now at 195 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.9 (2021-10-02) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5546359.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5546359)

* New function `df_to_msg()` can assist with error messages.
  `df_to_msg()` was moved from the `SEAPSUTWorkflow` package, 
  because it is generally useful.
* New tests for new features.
    * Now at 178 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.8 (2021-09-02) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5475444.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5475444)

* `matsindf.Rmd` vignette now uses the `keep` argument on `matsbyname::hatize_byname()`.
* Fixed a bug in the `matsindf.Rmd` vignette.
  Needed to supply the `keep` argument on `hatize_byname()`.
* Added test for name collision `matsindf_apply()`.
* New tests for new features.
    * Now at 177 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.7 (2021-04-11)

* Not released to CRAN, because there are no changes in the code itself.
* Move away from Travis to GitHub Actions for continuous integration testing.
* Added new tests for `matsindf_apply()` for 
  functions similar in form to those in `Recca`.
* Changed names of test files to "test-*.R" to conform to expectations.
* Removed `context()` calls at top of test files.
* Added a new test confirming that 
  passing a list with strings works with a `NULL` `.DF` in `matsindf_apply()`.
* New tests for new features.
    * Now at 176 tests, all passing.
    * Test coverage remains at 100 %.


# matsindf 0.3.6 (2020-08-24)

* To comply with a breaking change in `dplyr`, 
  all calls to `dplyr::group_by()` now use `.add` argument
  instead of `add` argument.


# matsindf 0.3.5 (2020-04-13)

* Now using GitHub actions for continuous integration
  and building the pkgdown site.


# matsindf 0.3.4 (2020-03-21)

* Maintenance release to prepare for `dplyr` 1.0.0.
  Several tests in `matsindf` assumed that some `dplyr` functions returned 
  `data.frame`s.
  Now that many `dplyr` functions return `tibble`s, the `matsindf` tests needed to be rewritten.
  All tests pass vs. `dplyr` 0.8.5.
  One warning remains when testing `matsindf` with `dplyr` 1.0.0,
  namely that the `add` argument of `group_buy()` is deprecated.
  When `dplyr` 1.0.0 is released to CRAN, 
  I will convert `add` to `.add`, per the `dplyr` authors' recommendation.


# matsindf 0.3.3 (2020-03-03)

* More maintenance to prepare for R4.0.0.
  Prior to R4.0.0, `data.frame()` has `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` by default.
  In R4.0.0, `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` will be the default.
  In one test ("small example works as expected"), 
  I was relying on the current behavior (`stringsAsFactors = TRUE`).
  That reliance has been removed so that this test will also pass under R4.0.0.


# matsindf 0.3.2 (2019-12-05)

* Maintenance release to prepare for R4.0.0.
  `matrix` objects now inherit from both `matrix` and `array`.
  Thus, code should no longer assume that `class(A)` returns an object of length 1 when `A` is a `matrix`.
  So, I eliminated all instances of `class(A) == "matrix"` in `if` statements
  in favor of `inherits(A, "matrix")`.
  See https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html
  for more details.


# matsindf 0.3.1 (2019-10-26)

* Refactored `group_by_everything_except()` to use a new helper function `everything_except()`
* New function `group_by_everything_except()`
* Added CRAN badge.


# matsindf 0.3.0 (2019-02-05)

* Address questions from CRAN: 
      - Title case: Matrices in Data Frames
      - `\dontrun{}` --> `\donttest{}` in Roxygen examples 
* Fully-qualified all function calls in `matsindf` functions.
* Now importing the `:=` and `.data` at a high level.
* Added TravisCI integration
* Added code coverage


# matsindf 0.2.12 (2019-01-07)

* Now importing the `magrittr` pipe at a high level.


# matsindf 0.2.11 (2018-11-13)

* Now creating README.md from README.Rmd for `pkgdown` documentation.


# matsindf 0.2.10 (2018-11-08)

* Breaking change: Default values of `rowtypes` and `coltypes` arguments to 
  `expand_to_tidy` and `collapse_to_matrices` functions are no longer `NULL`.
  Rather, they are "`rowtypes`" and "`coltypes`".


# matsindf 0.2.9 (2018-11-06)

* Extended the `matsindf_apply` primer to include sections on using `matsindf_apply` with a data frame and programming.


# matsindf 0.2.8 (2018-11-01)

* Added new vignette to documentation website, 
  which required moving from .Rnw to .Rmd file.


# matsindf 0.2.7 (2018-10-30)

* Added documentation website.


# matsindf 0.2.6 (2018-07-03)

* New function `index_column` that ratios both numbers and matrices relative to an initial time.
* Many documentation improvements.


# matsindf 0.2.5 (2018-05-23)

* `expand_to_tidy` now accepts a named list of matrices as input.


# matsindf 0.2.4 (2018-05-22)

* `matsindf_apply` now obtains named arguments from `.DF` 
  when a name in `.DF` matches a name of an argument to `FUN`.
  This behavior is overridden by supplying a string argument in `...` 
  of `matsindf_apply`.


# matsindf 0.2.3 (2018-05-22)

* `matsindf_apply` now accepts a list as input when arguments are all strings.


# matsindf 0.2.2 (2018-05-20)
