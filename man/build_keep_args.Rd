}
\arguments{
\item{where_to_find_args}{A list created by \code{where_to_get_args()}.}
}
\value{
A list with names \code{.dat}, \code{dots}, and \code{FUN} which
gives items to keep from each source.
}
\description{
In the process of building data frames of arguments to \code{FUN},
we need to decide which arguments to keep from each source,
\code{...}, \code{.dat}, and defaults to \code{FUN}.
This function does that work in one place.
