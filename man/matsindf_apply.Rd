\title{Apply a function to a \code{matsindf} data frame (and more)}
\usage{
matsindf_apply(.DF = NULL, FUN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.DF}{a list of named items or a data frame}

\item{FUN}{the function to be applied to \code{.DF}}

\item{...}{named arguments to be passed by name to \code{FUN}.}
}
\value{
a named list or a data frame. (See details.)
}
\description{
Applies \code{FUN} to \code{.DF} or
performs the calculation specified by \code{FUN}
on numbers or matrices.
\code{FUN} must return a named list.
}
\details{
If \code{is.null(.DF)} and \code{...} are all named numbers or matrices
of the form \code{argname = m},
\code{m}s are passed to \code{FUN} by \code{argname}s.
The return value is a named list provided by \code{FUN}.
The arguments in \code{...} are not included in the output.

If \code{is.null(.DF)} and \code{...} are all lists of numbers or matrices
of the form \code{argname = l},
\code{FUN} is \code{Map}ped across the various \code{l}s
to obtain a list of named lists returned from \code{FUN}.
The return value is a data frame
whose rows are the top-level lists returned from \code{FUN} and
whose column names are the names of the list items returned from \code{FUN}.
Columns of \code{.DF} are not included in the return value.

If \code{!is.null(.DF)} and \code{...} are all named character strings
of the form \code{argname = string},
\code{argname}s are expected to be names of arguments to \code{FUN}, and
\code{string}s are expected to be column names in \code{.DF}.
The return value is \code{.DF} with additional columns (at right)
whose names are the names of list items returned from \code{FUN}.
When \code{.DF} contains columns whose names are same as columns added at the right,
a warning is emitted.

\code{.DF} can be a list of named items in which case a list will be returned.

If items in \code{.DF} have same names are arguments to \code{FUN},
it is not necessary to specify any arguments in \code{...}.
\code{matsindf_apply} assumes that the appropriately-named items in \code{.DF} are
intended to be arguments to \code{FUN}.
When an item name appears in both \code{...} and \code{.DF},
\code{...} takes precedence.

\code{NULL} arguments in ... are ignored for the purposes of deciding whether
all arguments are numbers, matrices, lists of numbers of matrieces, or named character strings.
However, all \code{NULL} arguments are passed to \code{FUN},
so \code{FUN} should be able to deal with \code{NULL} arguments appropriately.

If \code{.DF} is present, \code{...} contains strings, and one of the \code{...} strings is not the name
of a column in \code{.DF},
\code{FUN} is called WITHOUT the argument whose column is missing.
I.e., that argument is treated as missing.
If \code{FUN} works despite the missing argument, execution proceeds.
If \code{FUN} cannot handle the missing argument, an error will occur in \code{FUN}.
